# 0x01. Caching

## Description

This repository contains projects and exercises focused on understanding and implementing caching systems. Caching is an essential concept in computer science, used to improve the efficiency and performance of systems by temporarily storing frequently accessed data. This repository will explore different caching algorithms and concepts such as FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, and LFU.

## Learning Objectives

By working through the content in this repository, you will learn:

- **What a caching system is**: Understand the basic principles and components of a caching system, and how it is used to optimize data retrieval and performance.
  
- **What FIFO means**: Learn about the First-In-First-Out caching algorithm, where the oldest cached items are the first to be removed when the cache reaches its limit.
  
- **What LIFO means**: Explore the Last-In-First-Out caching algorithm, where the most recently added items are removed first when the cache is full.
  
- **What LRU means**: Understand the Least Recently Used algorithm, which removes the least recently accessed items from the cache when space is needed.
  
- **What MRU means**: Learn about the Most Recently Used caching strategy, where the most recently accessed items are removed first.
  
- **What LFU means**: Discover the Least Frequently Used caching algorithm, where items that are accessed the least frequently are removed from the cache.
  
- **What the purpose of a caching system is**: Understand the reasons behind using caching systems, such as reducing latency, minimizing resource usage, and improving overall system performance.
  
- **What limits a caching system have**: Explore the inherent limitations of caching systems, including memory constraints, cache coherence, and the trade-offs between cache size and hit/miss rates.

## Usage

This repository is intended for educational purposes. Each concept and algorithm is implemented in a way that allows for experimentation and deeper understanding. Feel free to explore the different caching strategies and understand their applications in various scenarios.
